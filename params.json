{"name":"Linkedlist","tagline":"Simple LinkedList","body":"LinkedList\r\n==========\r\nOn a job interview, I got asked to create a generic linked list in java.\r\nIt is pretty easy; however, it has been a while since I wrote one of these.\r\nUnfortunately the linked list i wrote wasn't working the way I wanted. For\r\nthese reason, I decided to practice and write one. This repo contains a version\r\nof a simple linked list.\r\n\r\nTO DO:\r\n------\r\n    - Have some errors while deleting some elements. Could improve on how they\r\n      get deleted. Maybe use recursion.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
